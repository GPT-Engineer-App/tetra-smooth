# tetra-smooth

A meticulously designed Tetris game that focuses on a bug-free, enjoyable user experience. This version should emphasize robust programming and thorough testing to ensure smooth gameplay and interface interactions. The design should maintain simplicity and clarity, highlighting the classic Tetris aesthetic with a modern touch. Key features include responsive controls for rotating and positioning tetrominoes, a clear display of upcoming pieces, score, and level information. A pause/resume function is essential, along with a speed increase as levels progress to add challenge. High scores should be recorded for player motivation. The development process must include rigorous testing phases to identify and fix any potential bugs, ensuring a seamless experience for players.
